# extras  

A collection of random stuff that is here for no reason.
Feel free to put anything you want in here. It must follow the code-of-conduct,
contributing guidelines, and you cannot add anything that violates GitHub, PyPI,
and/or any other platforms the code is distributed on.
You also cannot add an `__init__.py` file because the code must not be distributed.
