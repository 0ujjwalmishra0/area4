Hello, I am here to learn GitHub. My fisrt time here. 
Not sure if this is allowed, but thought I would put this here in the extras folder and hope it would not be in anybody's way, 
while I learn. 
It says that a fork is created. I am not sure yet what a fork is/ does. But we were watching the good life the other 
day. Hilarious show! it's on Netflix. And, well she sais 'what the fork'. So yeah. 
cheers, Simone
